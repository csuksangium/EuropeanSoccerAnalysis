# An Analysis and Clustering of European League Soccer Players for CS506: Applied Data Science
This project uses European Soccer Player Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)

What differentiates a trequartista from a left back? We believe that a player's strength and weaknesses in certain skills help define a soccer position on the field, so our goal for this project is to perform clustering based on skill attributes, and we expect to see clusters into various playstyles. Further information about our analysis steps in correlation coefficient and K-Means clustering may be found in the poster below, or the final report in this repository.
